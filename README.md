### ABSTRACT 
The impact of automation on labor markets has become a central topic in economic and sociopolitical discourse. This thesis investigates the influence of occupational characteristics on employment trajectories within the European Union from 2012 to 2021. By employing a dual approach that includes a comprehensive descriptive analysis and the application of a Linear Mixed Model (LMM), this study aims to identify key variables affecting employment levels across occupations. Data is sourced from the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. Our findings suggest that the adoption of advanced technologies, specifically Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools, positively correlates with employment variation rates across different sectors. Conversely, the use of machines and engagement in repetitive tasks are associated with negative impacts on employment.
